# ðŸ’¾ Game Storage

> As I finished my first year of computer science, I wanted to create something of my own, I had just finished a C# project but I was looking for more. By creating this little app for windows, I aim to learn a lot of new stuff about .NET. So what is this app ? It's a simple "game storer", you enter informations about a game (name, release date and add an image) and boom, it goes onto the database. From there you can rate games and add some to your favourites. The idea is also to discover new games, that's why I include the trailer for each games.
